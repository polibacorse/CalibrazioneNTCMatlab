This software retrieves data from an MQTT-broker installed on a Raspberry Pi, in order to store them in an Excel spreadsheet. <br>
In particular this software interacts via MQTT with [CanQuery](https://github.com/polibacorse/CanQuery) in order to retrieve ECU data through CAN Bus.<br>
It also collects a known temperature from KEYSIGHT_34465A via USB.
